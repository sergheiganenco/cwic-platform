**The Problem with Competitors:**
```
Collibra/Monte Carlo: You create rules per table
- 100 tables × 5 rules = 500 rules to manage
- Each rule needs maintenance
- Inconsistent application
```

**Our Solution:**
```
Global Rule: "Null Value Detection"
├── Automatically discovers 100 tables
├── Scans 2,500 columns
├── Finds issues across all data
└── Single configuration point
```

**Impact:** 95% reduction in rule management overhead

### 2. **Intelligent Auto-Fix** 🔧
**Unique to Our System:**

```javascript
Example: Email Format Validation

Traditional tools:
1. Identify 1,000 invalid emails
2. Export to CSV
3. Manual fixing
4. Re-import data
Total time: 2 days

Our system:
1. Identify 1,000 invalid emails
2. AI suggests: "Apply standard format cleaning"
