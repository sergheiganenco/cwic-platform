```
You: "What are my biggest compliance risks?"
AI: "Your current risk profile shows 8 critical risks, 23 high risks.
     The biggest concern is unencrypted sensitive data in customer database.
     I recommend enabling field-level encryption immediately."

You: "Show all PII fields"
AI: "I found 127 PII fields. 15 are marked as critical risk.
     Would you like me to generate a detailed report or create
     automated policies?"

You: "Create policies for them"
AI: "I'll create 5 intelligent policies based on your data patterns.
     Generating now..."
